90% of the customers indicate that they would travel with XYZ again, but only about 15~25% of travelers book their next tour within 1 year. 
# Our Goals:
  1. Find the key-factors that make the 15~25% of the customer to repeat their travel.
  2. Identify customers who will likely repeat their travel.
